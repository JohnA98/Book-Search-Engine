# Book-Search-Engine

## Description

This app is designed as a search engine for books, using Google's api. This app uses the entire MERN stack as a functioning back end and front end application. I always want to read more, but never find myself with the right book in my hand. With this application, I can fix that.

## Installation

This app can be found deployed on Heroku.
